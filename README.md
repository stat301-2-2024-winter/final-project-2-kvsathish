## Overview

The NBA Draft is a special event where all 30 teams within the National Basketball Association have the opportunity to select young basketball player(s) for the future of their respective franchise. While there has been a recent transition to drafting players from overseas, I wanted to look into what specifically qualifies NCAA college basketball players to get selected by an NBA team in the draft. Becoming a professional basketball player is very difficult, with only about 1.2% of collegiate players making the jump to the NBA. Numerous factors play into an NBA selection, from athletic skills to prospective talent and discipline. 

The goal of this final project is to predict whether a NCAA college basketball player is drafted into the NBA. A variety of predictor variables along with six different model types are utilized on the manipulated target variable `pick`.
