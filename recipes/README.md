## Recipes

All the recipes/pre-processing/feature engineering for the various models are contained in this directory.

- `basic_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe for logistic regression models (e.g. logistic regression, elastic net/penalized logistic regression)
- `nb_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe for naive bayes model (baseline for final project)
- `trees_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe for tree based models (e.g. random forest, boosted tree)

- `off_rec.rda`: feature engineering recipe based on offensive output for logistic regression models (e.g. logistic regression, elastic net/penalized logistic regression)
- `off_trees.rda`: feature engineering recipe based on offensive output for tree based models (e.g. random forest, boosted tree)
